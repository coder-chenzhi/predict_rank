If you intend to use R to benefit from its friendliness for data mining. I recommend you to use RStudio. 
It provides community version with most functions, which is enough for us.
After you've installed the RStudio, remember to config the default CRAN mirror in "Tools - Global Options - Packages". When you install new packages, R will download packages from the CRAN mirror.
